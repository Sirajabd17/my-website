            Websites are files stored on servers, which are computers that host
            (fancy term for “store files for”) websites. These servers are
            connected to a giant network called the Internet. Browsers are
            computer programs that load websites via your Internet connection,

            to access these websites are known as “clients”

            to lose weight. Billions of app downloads are recorded by
            statisticians each year. Such popularity of the product led to
            choosing mobile app development career as a topic of this speech
